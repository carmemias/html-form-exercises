# Exercise 1: Input Fields

We have seen how to create an `<input type="text">` field. Use what you have learned to start creating the **Check Out** for the Code Your Future shop.

Please notice that, because the data entered on this form is going to be used and stored by the server, we will need to use set the `method="POST"` instead of `GET`.

1. Open `index.html` and add a form tag where it says `<!-- Your new form goes here -->`.

2. Add an input field to the form for the customer's first name. What type of input field will we need?

3. Add a second field for the customer's surname.

4. Add another field for the customer's email.

5. Add an input field for the customer's contact telephone number.

6. Finally, add the Submit button at the end of the form.
